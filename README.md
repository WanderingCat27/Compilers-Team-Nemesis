  '*' for comments
  mathematical operations are written out ('plus' = +)
  for loops = repeat followed by int
  while loops = while followed by condition
  to print use 'print' (string, decimal, int, word)
  if statements = 'is' statements followed by {}
  else if statements = 'if not' statements followed by {}
  functions = definition followed by (conditions)
  calling is the same as in java
  arrays = [decimal, int, or strings]
